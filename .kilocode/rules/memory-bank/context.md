# Project Context

## Current Status
The project is a fully functional web application for prompt engineering. Core features including prompt enhancement, quality scoring, user authentication, and prompt saving are implemented. The application uses a vanilla JS frontend communicating with a PHP backend and SQLite database.

## Recent Work
- **Authentication System:** Implemented secure login/register flow with PHP sessions.
- **Data Persistence:** Set up SQLite database for user accounts and saved prompts.
- **Prompt Library:** Created a public library of templates.
- **UI/UX:** Implemented responsive design, dark/light mode, and real-time feedback.

## Active Tasks
- **Documentation:** Initializing the Memory Bank to fully document the project state.
- **Refinement:** Potential visual improvements (referenced in open tabs) and code cleanup.

## Next Steps
1.  Complete Memory Bank initialization.
2.  Review and verify system architecture.
3.  Address any pending UI improvements or bug fixes.
4.  Consider adding more robust error handling or testing.
