# Product Overview: PromptRefinery

## Problem Statement
Users often struggle to get high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) because their prompts lack specificity, context, and structure. "Prompt Engineering" is a skill that takes time to learn, creating a gap between casual users and the full potential of AI tools.

## Solution
PromptRefinery is a web-based tool that bridges this gap by automatically enhancing user prompts. It takes a basic instruction and transforms it into a sophisticated, well-structured prompt optimized for modern LLMs. Beyond just rewriting, it educates users through real-time quality scoring and specific feedback.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity:** A clean, distraction-free interface that requires no technical setup.
- **Immediacy:** Real-time analysis and fast enhancement generation.
- **Education:** Users should learn *why* a prompt is better through the feedback system (e.g., "Added constraints," "Clarified audience").
- **Personalization:** Users can save their best prompts and build a personal library.
- **Accessibility:** Works on mobile and desktop, with accessible design patterns (dark/light mode, screen reader support).

## Key Features
1.  **AI Prompt Enhancement:** One-click transformation of simple queries into engineered prompts.
2.  **Quality Scoring:** Live analysis of prompt quality based on length, clarity, specificity, and constraints.
3.  **Temperature Control:** Users can adjust the "creativity" of the enhancement (Precise vs. Creative).
4.  **Prompt Library:** A public collection of high-quality templates for various use cases.
5.  **User Accounts:** Secure system to save, manage, and search personal prompt history.
6.  **Export Options:** Easy copying of prompts for use in ChatGPT, Claude, etc.

## Target Audience
- **Developers:** Generating code specs, API documentation requests.
- **Writers:** Overcoming writer's block, structuring creative writing tasks.
- **Business Professionals:** Drafting emails, reports, and strategic plans.
